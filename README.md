| Symbol | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| üëâ&nbsp;ACTION | It's time to take an action. If all you do is follow these lines, you will complete the workshop. |
| üß™&nbsp;CHECK&nbsp;POINT | It's time to confirm something's working. It's a good idea to check these, rather than jump from ACTION to ACTION, so that you can identify an issue early on. |
| _üí°&nbsp;TIP_ | Extra information should you want it. Skipping these will not affect your ability to complete the workshop. |
| _‚ö†&nbsp;LOOK&nbsp;OUT_ | Get a heads up about something that might not be obvious. Think of this as a TIP that's a bit more important to read. |                            |
